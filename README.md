# React useEffect Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook and asynchronous operations. The bug causes incomplete UI rendering due to improper error handling.  The `MyComponent` attempts to fetch data from an API, but its error handling isn't sufficient. 

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` uses `useEffect` with `async/await` to fetch data. If the API request fails (e.g., due to a network issue or server error), the error is caught, but the UI doesn't display a user-friendly error message. Instead, it might remain blank or partially rendered, resulting in a confusing user experience. The current implementation does not handle the loading state correctly and may not display loading indication in all scenarios.

## Solution

The solution involves enhancing the error handling to provide more informative feedback to the user and managing loading state more robustly. The improved error handling includes a user-friendly message and a retry mechanism to gracefully handle network failures. Also, the loading and error states are handled more completely to ensure proper UI update regardless of the API call outcome.
